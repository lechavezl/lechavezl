### Hi there 👋 my name is Luis Chavez and I'm 24 years old. I will share a little more about myself below:

- 💻 I am pursuing an Applied Technology BS degree at BYU-Idaho.
- 🎓 In April 2023 I completed my first certificate in Web & Computer Programming.
- 👨‍💻 I am currently pursuing a Web Development certificate.
- 💻 I am currently studying to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 🔍 I am looking to collaborate with others and help them in whatever they need if my current skills allow it.
- 🌐 I want to learn how to use GitHub correctly and enjoy the benefits of this great platform.
- 🌎 I want to develop useful tools so that others can benefit.
- 😄 Fun fact: My last name Chavez is the same as the former President of Venezuela. Most people don't remember it pleasantly so when they hear my last name they have funny reactions on their faces. P.S. **I am not related to the former president**. 😂

If you need to communicate with me, you can contact me through my email luisernestochavezleal@gmail.com
